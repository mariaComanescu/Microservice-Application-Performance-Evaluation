Performance Testing of Spring Boot Application with Parallel CRUD Operations Using MongoDB - JMeter Focus

Introduction: This performance testing initiative aims to assess the Spring Boot application's performance when subjected to concurrent CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, with a particular focus on using JMeter as the testing tool. The primary objective is to gauge the system's behavior under varying levels of load, identify performance bottlenecks, and optimize resource utilization.

Objective: The primary goals of this performance testing, leveraging JMeter, include:

Evaluate the application's responsiveness under concurrent CRUD operations. Measure the throughput and response times of CRUD operations. Identify potential performance bottlenecks and areas for improvement. Testing Environment: The testing environment includes:

Spring Boot Application: The target application developed using the Spring Boot framework. MongoDB Database: The underlying database system responsible for data storage. JMeter: The chosen performance testing tool to simulate concurrent user activity. Test Scenarios:

Concurrent Reads (GET Operations):

Use JMeter to simulate an increasing number of concurrent read operations. Measure the average response time and throughput for read operations. Concurrent Writes (POST/PUT Operations):

Employ JMeter to assess the application's performance under a load of concurrent write operations. Measure the processing time for each write request and overall throughput. Mixed Operations (Reads and Writes):

Configure JMeter to simulate a mixed workload with concurrent read and write operations. Analyze the impact on response times and system behavior. Scalability Testing:

Gradually increase the number of concurrent users using JMeter to assess the application's scalability. Monitor key performance metrics such as response times, throughput, and resource consumption. Performance Metrics (JMeter):

Response Time: Evaluate the average time taken for CRUD operations to complete. Throughput: Quantify the number of operations processed per unit of time. Concurrency: Assess the system's ability to handle multiple concurrent users.
