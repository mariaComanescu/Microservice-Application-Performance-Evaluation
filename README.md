Performance Testing of Spring Boot Application with Parallel CRUD Operations Using MongoDB - JMeter Focus

Introduction: This performance testing initiative aims to assess the Spring Boot application's performance when subjected to concurrent CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, with a particular focus on using JMeter as the testing tool. The primary objective is to gauge the system's behavior under varying levels of load, identify performance bottlenecks, and optimize resource utilization.

Objective: The primary goals of this performance testing, include:

Evaluate the application's responsiveness under concurrent CRUD operations. Measure the throughput and response times of CRUD operations. Identify potential performance bottlenecks and areas for improvement. Testing Environment: The testing environment includes:

Spring Boot Application: The target application developed using the Spring Boot framework. MongoDB Database: The underlying database system responsible for data storage.
